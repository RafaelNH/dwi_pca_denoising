# PCA denoising

This algorithm denoising data using a PCA. Code was implemeted based on the algorithm suggested by:

[Veraart et al. Denoising of diffusion MRI using random matrix theory (2016). Neuroimage 142:394-406](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5159209/)

This algorithm is the reference code that I've implemented for my PhD thesis:

[Neto Henriques, R. (2018). Advanced Methods for Diffusion MRI Data Analysis and their Application to the Healthy Ageing Brain (Doctoral thesis). https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.29356](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/281993)

If you use this code, please cite the two references pointed above.
